The code for the implementation of “[Yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) + [Circular Smooth Label](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05597v2)”. 


# Installation
Please refer to [install.md](./docs/install.md) for installation and dataset preparation.


# Getting Started 
This repo is based on [yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5). 
 
And this repo has been rebuilt, Please see [GetStart.md](./docs/GetStart.md) for the Oriented Detection latest basic usage.
